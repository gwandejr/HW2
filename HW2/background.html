    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I have a <span class="bold_para_text">Bachelors Degree in Business</span> from <span class="bold_para_text">Cleveland State University</span> where I <span class="bold_para_text">majored in Finance</span>.  I received my <span class="bold_para_text">Graduate Degree in Business</span> from <span class="bold_para_text">Indiana Wesleyan University</span>.  I'm currently attending <span class="bold_para_text">Cuyahoga Community College</span>.    
    </p>
    
    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>I've worked in <span class="bold_para_text">Mortgage Banking</span> for almost 19 years mainly as a <span class="bold_para_text">Financial Reporting Analyst</span>.  I specialized in production and profitability statistics on the origination side of the mortgage business.  My strengths revolve around <span class="bold_para_text">querying data warehouses</span>, producing <span class="bold_para_text">management reports</span>, and <span class="bold_para_text">streamlining and automating report processes</span> from an end user perspective.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Some Accomplishments Include:</h1>
    <h3>Data Expertise</h3>
    <p>Being the author of <span class="bold_para_text">production statistics</span> for the Mortgage Division of the company where the totals I derived were published in the <span class="bold_para_text">company financials</span> and <span class="bold_para_text">peer group surveys</span>, and was used for <span class="bold_para_text">licensing and regulatory audits</span>.</p>
    
    <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
    <p>Completely overhauled the report process used to report application volume to the <span class="bold_para_text">Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA)</span> that was in place before I started working for the company.  After extensive research and testing, discovered erroneous data being reported and data being missed due to business process changes, timing, and outdated logic.  As a result of the changes I implemented, produced a more accurate data set that didn't change over time and could be reconciled when looking back.  This allowed for more accurate <span class="bold_para_text">industry data forecasts</span> which impacts budgeting.</p>
    
    <h3>Sales Metrics</h3>
    <p>Created and maintained a process that switched the <span class="bold_para_text">Sales Incentive Methodology</span> from being <span class="bold_para_text">profitability-based</span> to being <span class="bold_para_text">volume-driven</span> that incentivized for not only the amount of business a client was bringing in but also how many new clients with business were coming on board.</p>

    <h3>Automation</h3>
    <p>Created an end-user <span class="bold_para_text">overnight batch job</span> process using <span class="bold_para_text">Microsoft Access and Excel</span> where numerous daily reports would run automatically updating with new production and available before the start of business.</p>
