    <h3>Watching Movies</h3>
    <p>I tend to be somewhat of a home-body, so I like spending time at home relaxing with my family.  One of my favorite hobbies is watching movies.  I'm mainly interested in home theater.  Not just turning on Netflix or popping in a DVD, but rather more of the high-definition audio/video content only found in Blu-Ray discs or higher quality discs.  Even though content may be marked as high-definition (HD) in streaming applications, I've found that the only way to not only get the higher quality picture but also the higher quality sound is to play a disc.  And the sound is what intrigues me the most.    
    </p>
    
    <h3>Home Theater</h3>
    <p>Over the years I've been able to overhaul old speakers that I kept since I was a teenager and make some electronics add-ons and upgrades to yield a decent sounding home system on an average family-man's budget.  I really get into the movie special effects especially when sight and sound are matched together well.  I must admit, this means that I often watch movies more for the special effects than the plot or quality of the acting.  I end up watching a lot of superhero movies because there are plenty of them out there now and they all tend to be geared up more with special effects.  I really get into the sound though.
    </p>
    
    <p>What am I referring to when it comes to the sound?  Well, I like the <span class="bold_para_text">bass</span> produced by HD tracks.  It's called the <span class="bold_para_text">Low Frequency Effect (LFE)</span>.  It's the deep and sometimes subsonic sound of the movie track.  This creates the low rumbles of explosions, earthquakes, dinosaur stomps, etc. - you get the drift.  So it's not just what's heard but what's felt to give a realistic experience.  This is the type of sound that can only be achieved through HD movie tracks that are specifically engineered that way in the studio for a surround sound audio system - or a system with multiple speakers with each playing a specific role but all working together in tandem.  Aside from the bass, a good surround sound system in all areas is needed to optimize the sound quality.  For example, a scene from a jungle on a good surround sound system will make it seem like the animal sounds are all around you as if you're in the movie.  The same with the sound of a ricochet or a helicopter passing.</p>

    <h3>Favorite Movie</h3>
    <p>My favorite movie so far is a movie called <span class="bold_para_text">Interstellar</span>.  It's a movie about interstellar space travel which appeals to my childhood interests.  I've always been interested in space and the cosmos in general since I was a kid.  If I could do it all over again I would be an astronomer or astrophysicist.  The movie explores <span class="bold_para_text">Einstein's Theory of Relativity</span> in graphic detail.  The special effects are top notch and look and sound realistic.  There're some amazing scenes where they travel through a <span class="bold_para_text">worm hole</span> and eventually a <span class="bold_para_text">black hole</span>.  Not only that, but the plot is really thought-provoking and in some ways mind-blowing.  A very intelligent movie in my opinion.</p>
